ABOUT

the birdseye distribution has four main parts:

1) a full-screen, moving-map navigation app (birdseye.py)
2) a GPS tracking subsystem and logger (gpsmgr.py)
3) a tool to locally cache data from mapservers for offline use (mapcache.py)
4) a web console to explore the tile cache, manage waypoints and regions for download (web/webconsole.py)



CONFIGURATION

sample tile url spec: 'http://{s:0-3}.mapserver.org/tile/{z}/{x}/{y}.{type}'

available directives:

{z} - zoom level
{x} - tile x coordinate, [0, 2^zoom)
{y} - tile y coordinate, [0, 2^zoom)
{-y} - tile y coordinate, but numbered starting in the south and increasing towards the north (i.e., for WMS layers)
{qt} - quadtree index to tile (i.e., for bing layers)
{qt:ABCD} - quadtree index, but with customized symbols to refer to each quadrant
{s:0-3} - server shard (0, 1, 2, 3, in this example)
{s:abc} - server shard (a, b, c, in this example)
{type} - the specified file type for the layer
